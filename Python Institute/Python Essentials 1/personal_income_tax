# Exercise 3.1.11 (Tax calculator)
# A tax calculator that computes the Personal Income Tax (PIT) 
# based on a citizen's income, applying an 18% rate with a tax relief 
# for incomes up to 85,528 thalers, and a fixed tax amount plus a 
# 32% rate on the surplus for higher incomes, rounding the result to 
# the nearest whole thaler while ensuring no negative tax values.
income = float(input("Enter the annual income: "))

#
# Write your code here.
#
if income <= 85528: tax = .18 * income - 556.2
else: tax = 14839.2 + .32 * (income - 85528)

if tax < 0: tax = 0.0
tax = round(tax, 0)
print("The tax is:", tax, "thalers")
