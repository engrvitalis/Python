# Exercise 3.1.12 (Leap year calculator)
# If the year is not divisible by 4, it is a common year.
# If it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
# If it is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is a common year.
# If it is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

#
# Write your code here.
#	
# Check if the year is within the Gregorian calendar period
if year < 1582:
    print("Not within the Gregorian calendar period.")
else:
# Determine if it's a leap year or a common year
    if year % 4 != 0:
        print("Common year")
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        print("Leap year")
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        print("Common year")
    else:
